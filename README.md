Clock-sketch: a sketch-based algorithm with clock framework that can address item batch measurement

This repostory contains all the codes related to the manuscript submitted to SIGMOD 2021.

BOBHash is used as the hash function in the code.

Technical_report is the paper which contains all pseudo codes for four algorithms.

We give both single thread and multiple thread implementation for Clock-sketch.
